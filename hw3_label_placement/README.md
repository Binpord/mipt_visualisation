# Label placement

[Automatic label placement algorithm, based on 2-satisfiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_label_placement#2-satisfiability_algorithms). 2-satisfiability problem is solved using the [polynomial algorithm based on strongly connected components in implication graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-satisfiability#Strongly_connected_components). Example of usage is available at `label_placement.ipynb`.
